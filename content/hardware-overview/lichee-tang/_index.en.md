## The Lichee Tang at a Glance

![Lichee Tang at a Glance](/hardware-overview/lichee-tang/images/E203_function.png "Lichee Tang at a Glance")

Lichee Tang uses Anlogic's EG4S20 as the core unit, 20K logic unit (LUT4/LUT5 hybrid architecture), approximately 130KB SRAM, built-in 32bit bit width 64MBit SDRAM, rich LVDS pin, built-in 12-bit 1MSPS ADC This provides unlimited possibilities for Lichee Tang:

## Lichee Tang features

+ FPC40P socket, can be connected to RGB LCD, VGA adapter board, high speed DAC module.
+ FPC24P socket, can be connected to DVP camera, high speed ADC module.
+ Resistive touch screen controller for I2C interface, used with RGB LCD.
+ 3-channel DCDC power supply chip, stable and efficient power supply, independent adjustment of Bank0 IO level.
+ FPGA configuration Flash, 8Mbit User Flash, nor/nand optional.
+ Onboard FPGA JTAG Download Debugger.
+ Onboard RGB LED
+ The adjacent pins LVDS are drawn in the same length, and 8 GCLKs are taken out, and 8 ADCs are all taken out.
+ The double row pin spacing is 900 mils and is compatible with breadboard development.
+ The half hole leads to an additional 40 IO and the entire board leads to 130+ IO.
